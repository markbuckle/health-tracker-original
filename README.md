# Personalized Health Tracker

Many patients globally do not have complete access to their healthcare records. Even when they do, the information is not provided in a way that allows patients to understand their data while being provided with actionable takeaways.

This project was originally built with [WebFlow](https://WebFlow.com). WebFlow is a great tool for HTML, CSS & JavaScript. On the downside, once you use their CMS, it cannot be exported. I decided to export the code at this stage before integrating a user authentication system, database/CMS, and other data related tools. Since exporting the original code, I have been updating the code to ensure it is more readible, maintainable and scalable. The remainder of this project will be built in VS code. 

Other notes:
- The report bar charts & graphs were built with [Apex Charts](https://apexcharts.com/)
- Modals can be found on the Profile page.
