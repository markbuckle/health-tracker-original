# Personalized Health Tracker

Many patients globally do not have access to their healthcare records. Even when they do, the information is not provided in a way that allows patients to understand their data and take actionable takeaways.

This project was built with [WebFlow](https://WebFlow.com). I have exported the code and I am currently working on making the code more readible, maintainable and scalable.

The reports bar charts & graphs were built with [Apex Charts](https://apexcharts.com/)

This project is a work in progress. My next step is to complete the user pages / authentication then build the framework for the content management system.
