# Personalized Health Tracker

Many patients globally do not have access to their healthcare records. Even when
they do, the information is not provided in a way that allows patients to
understand their data and take actionable takeaways.

This project was built with [WebFlow](https://WebFlow.com). I have exported the
code and I am currently working on making the code more readible, maintainable
and scalable.

The reports bar charts & graphs were built with
[Apex Charts](https://apexcharts.com/)

This project is a work in progress. My next step is to complete the user pages /
authentication then build the framework for the content management system.

Please see the currently deployed site here: https://healthdashboard.webflow.io/

Things to consider as the project scales:

- Implementing a build process to optimize Webflow-exported assets.
- Setting up environment-specific configurations.
- Implementing server-side rendering if needed for performance or SEO.
